# 🧠 Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository documents my practical journey through **Machine Learning**, organized progressively — from data preprocessing to model deployment.  
The goal is to demonstrate **technical understanding, algorithmic reasoning, and continuous evolution** throughout the machine learning lifecycle.

## 📂 Learning Structure

### 1️⃣ [Data Preprocessing](./01_data-preprocessing)
Exploration and preparation of raw datasets — cleaning, normalization, and visualization.  
Using libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
> Status: 🟡 *In progress*

---

### 2️⃣ [Supervised Learning](./02_supervised-learning)
Supervised models for **regression and classification** with **scikit-learn**.  
Comparing metrics (R², MAE, RMSE, AUC) and performing hyperparameter tuning.  
> Status: 🔵 *Planned*

---

### 3️⃣ [Unsupervised Learning](./03_unsupervised-learning)
Pattern discovery and clustering using **K-Means, PCA, and DBSCAN**.  
Exploring underlying structures and relationships in complex datasets.  
> Status: 🟠 *Coming soon*

---

### 4️⃣ [Model Deployment](./04_model-deployment)
Deploying machine learning models as APIs and interactive dashboards.  
Using **FastAPI**, **Streamlit**, and **Render** for production environments.  
> Status: 🟣 *Coming soon*

---

### 5️⃣ [Projects](./05_projects)
Complete end-to-end projects combining all previous stages.  
- ✅ [Car Efficiency Classifier](https://car-efficiency-app-by-ari-soares.streamlit.app/) — *Streamlit App*  
- 🔜 Real Estate Price Prediction  
- 🔜 Telecom Churn Analysis  
> Status: 🟢 *Active*
